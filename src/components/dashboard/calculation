Explanation of Calculations in StatsGrid.jsx
Here's how the data is calculated for each stat in the dashboard:

1. Total Revenue
Source: Fetched from /api/dashboard-orders (all orders data).
Calculation: Sum of (quantity * price) for every order in the array.
Example: If there are 3 orders: (10 * 100) + (5 * 200) + (2 * 150) = ₹1,000 + ₹1,000 + ₹300 = ₹2,300.


2. Profit
Source: Calculated from Revenue and Cost.
Calculation: Total Revenue - Total Cost.
Example: If Revenue is ₹2,300 and Cost is ₹1,500, Profit = ₹2,300 - ₹1,500 = ₹800.

3. Cost
Source: Fetched from /api/employees (all employees data).
Calculation: Sum of salary for every employee in the array.
Example: If there are 3 employees with salaries: ₹50,000 + ₹40,000 + ₹30,000 = ₹120,000.

4. Customer Orders
Source: Fetched from /api/dashboard-orders (all orders data).
Calculation: Count of orders where type === "customers".
Example: If there are 10 total orders and 7 are customer orders, it shows 7.

Data Flow:

Fetch Employees: Get all employees from backend.
Calculate Cost: Sum up salary for all employees.
Calculate Profit: Revenue - Cost.
Count Customer Orders: Filter orders by type and count.
Display: Format all values in Indian Rupees and render in the grid.
The calculations update automatically whenever the component mounts, reflecting real-time data from the backend.
